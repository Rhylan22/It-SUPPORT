## About Me

I'm an IT Support professional with 5 years of hands-on experience supporting end-users in live environments. My background includes Active Directory administration, Windows troubleshooting, hardware support, printer support, and IT documentation. I'm currently pursuing my CompTIA Security+ certification and a B.S. in Computer Information Systems.

This portfolio documents real lab work and simulations I've completed to build and sharpen my help desk and IT support skills.
